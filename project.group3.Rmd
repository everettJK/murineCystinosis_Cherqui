# Summary of results

The goal of this analysis is to investigate the integration profile of a gene therapy vector for the correction of cystinosis 
in mouse subjects and assess potential clonal expansions. The list of mouse oncogenes was compiled from the retroviral tagged 
cancer gene database (RTCGD)^1^ using an inclusion threshold of three or more incidents where the mouse oncogene list comprises 
`r mouseGenomePercentOnco`% of all mouse genes. The frequency of integration near oncogenes was 
generally less than that of mice in a previously published $\beta$-thalassemia mouse trial from which no adverse events have 
been reported ^2^.  The code base for this analysis is available online ([link](https://github.com/everettJK/project.geneTherapy.ucsdMouseCystinosis)).

# Mouse samples studied

Integration sites were detected in `r length(unique(intSites$GTSP))` samples from mouse subjects (Tables 1 & S1).

Subject specific reports for all subjects are available via an online archive ([link](http://bushmanlab.org/data/export/projects/gtVISA/CYS/)).

# UCSC browser exploration
UCSC browser sessions pre-loaded with the integration sites identified in this analysis are available via this  
([link](http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?org=mouse&db=mm9&hgt.customText=http://microb120.med.upenn.edu/UCSC/cherqui/UCSC_CYS_mouse.group3.ucsc)). 
Integration sites are shown as blue (positive orientation integration) and red (reverse orientation integration) tick marks. For each integration site, 
the intensity of the color reflects the maximum abundance observed.

# Description of analysis techniques  

We investigate effects of integration on cell growth using the following criteria:
Integration Frequency is the frequency at which unique integration sites are observed in or near a given gene.
Clonal Abundance is determined by quantifying the number of sites of linker ligation associated with each unique integration
site. This samples the number of DNA chains at the start of the experiment allowing clonal expansion to be quantified^4^.  

Relative clonal Abundance is determined per sample and is the percentage of identified cells attributed to a given clone.
Integration sites and the clones harboring them are sampled from a larger population. It would be rare for all integration
sites in a sample to be represented in the sequence data.  
  
For this analysis, four technical replicates of each delivered sample were prepared, sequenced and analyzed with the 
INSPIIRED integration site analysis pipeline (v1.2)^4^.

# Comparisons to previous trials

## Integration events near oncogenes in mouse subjects  

\vspace{0.1cm}

In order to determine if the experimental vector has a higher propensity of integrating near suspected oncogene in mice than
previously employed vectors, the frequency of integration near oncogenes was compared to a previously published mouse trial^2^ 
which used a comparable lentiviral vector to correct $\beta$-thalassemia.  The frequency of integration events near onco genes 
in *all transfected mice* was less than the mean frequency of integration events near oncogenes in the published trial 
(Figure 1 [experimental subjects: gray, previous $\beta$-thalassemia trial: blue]).

# Relative abundances of mouse subject samples

# Mouse transplant trials  

The positions of identified integration sites from cell transplant trials with nine pairs of mice are shown in Figure 4a (donor
mice) and Figure 4b (recipient mice). The gRxCluster software package did not identify clusters of integration sites
between donor and recipient mice with a false discovery rate of $\leq$ 10%.
The relative clonal abundances of samples from the transplant trials are shown in Figure 5 where donor mice are shown on
the left and recipient mice are shown on the right. Integration sites are denoted by both nearest gene and genomic coordinate
and annotated with an asterisk (*) if located within transcription units and with a tilda (~) if the integration site is within 
50 KB of an oncogene. Below each abundance plot is a Fisherâ€™s exact test for the enrichment of oncogenes. None of the tests returned
a significant result. Instances where no integration sites were identified in the recipient mouse are listed as 'NA'. 
The clonal abundances of clones found in both donor and recipient mice is shown in Table S2. The
identification of relatively few persistent clones is likely due to sequencing experiments sampling only a subset of existing
integration sites and a number of samples with low vector copy numbers (Figures 4B & S3).
