# Summary of results

The goal of this analysis is to investigate the integration profile of a gene therapy vector for the correction of cystinosis 
in mouse subjects and assess potential clonal expansions. The list of mouse oncogenes was compiled from the retroviral tagged 
cancer gene database (RTCGD)^1^ using an inclusion threshold of three or more incidents where the mouse oncogene list comprises 
`r mouseGenomePercentOnco`% of all mouse genes. The frequency of integration near oncogenes was 
generally less than that of mice in a previously published $\beta$-thalassemia mouse trial from which no adverse events have 
been reported ^2^.  The code base for this analysis is available online 
([link](https://github.com/everettJK/project.geneTherapy.ucsdMouseCystinosis)).

Twenty-nine mice were tested by serial transfer of vector-treated bone marrow. From these, 64,413 cells were sampled, yielding 3,647 total unique integration sites.  In both donor and recipient samples, there was no overall increase in integration sites near annotated murine cancer-associated genes, thus providing no evidence for genotoxicity.  Some cells expanded more than others, but analysis of cells showing the most pronounced expansion showed no enrichment in integration sites in or near cancer-associated genes.
In one case, decendants of a single cell appears to have mainly repopulated a test mouse (pCN801).  This cell appears to have harbored ~12 independent integration events, and proliferated robustly, so that the final specimen showed a VCN of 9.58.  Upon transfer to a recipient mouse (pCN951), the cell clone proliferate sluggishly (VCN 0.083), suggesting that despite the number of integration events, no major change in growth properties took place.  None of the 12 genes are annotated as cancer associated genes.  Specimens of integration into human cells in culture were also compared (VIS UCSD CYS Report.group1).  Results showed no favored integration near cancer associated genes compared to previous studies of integration site distributions.  Thus the tests of integration site distributions here provide no strong evidence for genotoxicity of the vector analyzed greater than for vectors used safely to date in ongoing human trials.

Integration sites are shown as blue (positive orientation integration) and red (reverse orientation integration) tick marks. For each integration site, 
a second track provides the maximum clonal abundance. Entering gene names into the search bar will direct the browser to specific genes.

# Description of analysis techniques  

We investigate effects of integration on cell growth using the following criteria:
Integration Frequency is the frequency at which unique integration sites are observed in or near a given gene.
Clonal Abundance is determined by quantifying the number of sites of linker ligation associated with each unique integration
site. This samples the number of DNA chains at the start of the experiment allowing clonal expansion to be quantified^4^.  

Relative clonal Abundance is determined per sample and is the percentage of identified cells attributed to a given clone.
Integration sites and the clones harboring them are sampled from a larger population. It would be rare for all integration
sites in a sample to be represented in the sequence data.  
  
For this analysis, four technical replicates of each delivered sample were prepared, sequenced and analyzed with the 
INSPIIRED integration site analysis pipeline (v1.2)^4^.

# Comparisons to previous trials


## Integration events near oncogenes in mouse subjects  

\vspace{0.1cm}

In order to determine if the experimental vector has a higher propensity of integrating near suspected oncogene in mice than
previously employed vectors, the frequency of integration near oncogenes was compared to a previously published mouse trial^2^ 
which used a comparable lentiviral vector to correct $\beta$-thalassemia. The frequency of integration events near oncogenes 
in the subjects was less than the mean frequency of integration events near oncogenes in the published trial 
(Figure 1 [experimental subjects: gray, previous $\beta$-thalassemia trial: blue]).

# Mouse transplant trials  

The positions of identified integration sites from cell transplant trials with nine pairs of mice are shown in Figure 4a (donor
mice) and Figure 4b (recipient mice). The gRxCluster software package did not identify clusters of integration sites
between donor and recipient mice with a false discovery rate of $\leq$ 10%.
The relative clonal abundances of samples from the transplant trials are shown in Figure 5 where donor mice are shown on
the left and recipient mice are shown on the right. Integration sites are denoted by both nearest gene and genomic coordinate
and annotated with an asterisk (*) if located within transcription units and with a tilda (~) if the integration site is within 
50 KB of an oncogene. Below each abundance plot is a Fisherâ€™s exact test for the enrichment of oncogenes. None of the tests returned
a significant result. Instances where no integration sites were identified in the recipient mouse are listed as 'NA'. 
The clonal abundances of clones found in both donor and recipient mice is shown in Table S2. The
identification of relatively few persistent clones is likely due to sequencing experiments sampling only a subset of existing
integration sites and a number of samples with low vector copy numbers (Figures 4B & S3).
