# Summary of results

The goal of this analysis is to investigate the integration profile of a gene therapy vector for the correction of cystinosis 
in both mouse and human subjects and assess potential clonal expansions. The list of human oncogenes used throughout 
this analysis was compiled from the literature ([link](http://www.bushmanlab.org/assets/doc/allOnco_Feb2017.tsv)) 
and the list of mouse oncogenes was compiled from the retroviral tagged cancer gene database (RTCGD)^1^ using an 
inclusion threshold of three or more incidents. The human oncogene list comprises `r humanGenomePercentOnco`% of 
all human genes (NCBI RefSeq) whereas the mouse oncogene list comprises `r mouseGenomePercentOnco`% of all mouse genes. 
The frequency of integration sites in human subjects near oncogenes was not significantly different than a published trial 
using a comparable vector to correct Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) from which no adverse events have been reported^2^. 
The frequency of integration sites in bone marrow donor mice near oncogenes was generally less than that of mice in a previously 
published $\beta$-thalassemia mouse trial from which no adverse events have been reported ^3^. The integration position profile 
for human subjects was very similar to that found in the WAS trial. The mouse bone marrow transplant trials yielded varying degrees 
of persistence in five of the nine trials where detection was limited due to both sequencing depth and vector copy number. 
No significant enrichment of integration events near oncogenes was identified between donor and recipient mice. The code base 
for this analysis is available on-line ([link](https://github.com/everettJK/project.geneTherapy.ucsdMouseCystinosis)).

# Human and mouse samples studied

Integration sites were detected in `r length(unique(intSites$GTSP))` samples from both human and mouse subjects (Tables 1 & S1) 
while no integration sites were detected in `r length(samplesNoIntSitesFound)` of the provided samples (Table S2).

# Description of analysis techniques  

We investigate effects of integration on cell growth using the following criteria:
Integration Frequency is the frequency at which unique integration sites are observed in or near a given gene.
Clonal Abundance is determined by quantifying the number of sites of linker ligation associated with each unique integration
site. This samples the number of DNA chains at the start of the experiment allowing clonal expansion to be quantified^4^.  

Relative clonal Abundance is determined per sample and is the percentage of identified cells attributed to a given clone.
Integration sites and the clones harboring them are sampled from a larger population. It would be rare for all integration
sites in a sample to be represented in the sequence data.  
  
For this analysis, four technical replicates of each delivered sample were prepared, sequenced and analyzed with the 
INSPIIRED integration site analysis pipeline (v1.2)^5^.

# Comparisons to previous trials

## Integration events near oncogenes in human subjects

In order to determine if the experimental vector has a higher propensity of integrating near suspected oncogene in humans
than previously employed vectors, the frequency of integration near oncogenes was compared to a previously published human
trial^1^ which used a comparable lentiviral vector to correct Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) where no adverse events have
been reported to date. The frequency of integration near oncogenes in four WAS pre-transplant patient samples was compared
to the frequency of integration in the experimental day 14 samples (Figure 1 [CYS: gray, WAS: blue]). The frequencies of integration near oncogenes of samples in this study and the previous WAS study were not significantly
different (Mann-Whitney U-test p-value: `r round(wilcox.test(humanSitesNearOnco$percentNearOnco, wasSitesNearOnco$percentNearOnco, correct = FALSE)$p.value, 3)`).

## Integration events near oncogenes in mouse subjects  

\vspace{0.1cm}

In order to determine if the experimental vector has a higher propensity of integrating near suspected oncogene in mice than
previously employed vectors, the frequency of integration near oncogenes was compared to a previously published mouse trial^3^ which used a comparable lentiviral vector to correct $\beta$-thalassemia. The frequency of integration events near onco genes 
in bone marrow donor mice was generally less than the mean frequency of integration events near oncogenes in the published trial (Figure 2 [CYS: gray, $\beta$-thalassemia trial: blue]).

# Mapping of integration site positions
Heat maps of identified integration sites are shown below in Figure 3a (human subjects) & 3b (mouse subjects). The integration
position profile from human subjects is very similar to the profile from the previous WAS study (Figure S2).

# Relative abundances of human subject samples

The sample relative abundance plots below (Figure 4) show the most abundant 25 clones in each human sample as colored 
bars while less abundant clones were relegated to a single low abundance bar shown in gray. Subject DON.002.4.SC 
showed an expanded clone (27% relative abundance) with an integration event down stream of the non-coding RNA gene LOC105374704. 
Subject pCYS.013.PS (PBCD34-MOI40) showed an expanded clone (27% relative abundance) with an integration event within intron 10 of ARFGEF1. 
These two expanded clones are not of immediate concern given that such expanded clones appeared in the WAS trial used 
for comparison (Figure S1) and both samples contained relatively few inferred cells which inflate relative abundance values.

# Mouse transplant trials  

The positions of identified integration sites from cell transplant trials with nine pairs of mice are shown in Figure 5a (donor
mice) and Figure 5b (recipient mice). The gRxCluster software package did not identify clusters of integration sites
between donor and recipient mice with a false discovery rate of $\leq$ 10%.
The relative clonal abundances of samples from the transplant trials are shown in Figure 6 where donor mice are shown on
the left and recipient mice are shown on the right. Integration sites are denoted by both nearest gene and genomic coordinate
and annotated with an asterisk (*) if located within transcription units and with a tilda (~) if the integration site is within 
50 KB of an oncogene. Below each abundance plot is a Fisherâ€™s exact test for the enrichment of oncogenes. None of the tests returned
a significant result. The clonal abundances of clones found in both donor and recipient mice is shown in Table S3. The
identification of relatively few persistent clones is likely due to sequencing experiments sampling only a subset of existing
integration sites and a number of samples with low vector copy numbers (Figures 5B & S3).

## Comparison of the number of integration sites and inferred cells  

Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov tests show no significant differences between the distributions of estimated abundances between trials. The plot below was truncated at 100 inferred cells for clarity which eliminated 16 data points from the â€˜WAS m12â€™ distriubtion.
